Title: Implement Domain Services for Business Logic
Description: As a developer, I want to implement domain services that encapsulate complex business logic and coordinate between multiple repositories to ensure business rules are enforced.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Create service interfaces for each domain aggregate
- Implement service classes with business logic

- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Add event dispatching for domain events
- Include proper logging and monitoring
- Add unit and integration tests
- Document all public methods and interfaces
- Implement proper input validation
- Support batch operations where applicable

Technical Details:
- Use dependency injection for repository dependencies
- Implement proper transaction management
- Use DTOs for data transfer
- Implement proper error handling
- Add proper logging
- Use domain events for side effects
- Implement proper validation
- Use proper design patterns
- Follow SOLID principles
- Implement proper exception handling
